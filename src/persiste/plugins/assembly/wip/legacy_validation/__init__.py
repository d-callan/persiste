"""Validation scripts for assembly constraint inference.

This directory contains reusable scripts for comprehensive validation of assembly constraints:
- Feature-level null tests (Stage I)
- Deterministic screen sweeps (Stage II)
- Null calibration sweeps (V1)
- Power grids (V2)
- Specificity tests (V3)
- Stratified heterogeneity experiments (V)

Each script is designed to be run independently and outputs CSV/JSON results for analysis.
