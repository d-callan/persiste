 ---------------------- THE PARAMETERS ----------------------------
Likelihood computation is performed while acounting for un-oberved data
With min number of presences('1's)= 1
With min number of absences('0's)= 0
'Reversible'(Root.freq==stationary.freq) model is used
RootFreq EQ stationary (taken from each sp - gain/(gain+loss) )

inSeq file: /home/dcallan-adm/Documents/veg/persiste/tool_comparison_output/gloome_run/sequences.fa
log: gainLoss.log with level= 5
gain , loss ~ Gamma(Alpha,Beta) 
gain - a Gamma prior distribution with: 1 categories
loss - a Gamma prior distribution with: 1 categories
Optimization of the model parmeters is performed
rate inference method is: maximum likelihood (ML) 
branch lengths are not optimized
gain and loss 4site are calculated 
calculePosteriorExpectationOfChange is done Analytically
